# Care

We connect people who need child care with people who want to give it.

## What we do

We find qualified care givers and match them up with people who need assistance with their children.
Our expert group of advisors work together to provide a comprehensive plan to assist with the needs of your children.
We find immediate child care to give hard working parents the time off that they deserve. Or we can
match your child with a practitioner to help them develop in a safe and caring environment.

We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to provide the best possible care for their children.

## Who we are

X is backed by a team of world class care givers and the best technology talent.
