# Care

We connect people who need child care with people who are qualified to give it.

## What we do

We find qualified care givers and match them up with people who need assistance with their children.
Our expert group of advisors work together to provide a comprehensive plan to assist with the needs of your children.
We find immediate child care to give hard working parents the time off that they deserve. Or we can
match your child with a practitioner to help them develop in a safe and caring environment.

We believe that everyone should have access to the tools they need to provide the best possible care for their children.

## Who we are

X is backed by a team of world class care givers and the best technology talent.

### Example - Personal Profile

Hi,

My name is Allison. I am a wife, mother and primary care giver to our two children.
I work part time so that I can be actively involved in the daily activities of our growing children.
As my children grow older, I seem to find a little more time to help others. I love
working with children and have time to give.

I have completed the following certifications:

* low arousal
* first aid
* child care level 1


I live in NW Calgary and I'm looking for opportunities to work near my home and with children
on a part time basis. If you're in need of assistance, I would like to help.

## I provide care

> I have a few spare hours here and there that I would love to use to help others.

> I am qualified and have the appropriate experience to provide care.

> I am willing to submit to a criminal background check.

If you're interested in joining our group of expert advisors and care givers, this is what you can expect.

When you register with our program we will ask you a series of questions to help us understand
what type of care you're able to provide. If you're a match, one of our existing advisors will
connect with you for a face to face conversation to see if we're able to provide you with the opportunities
that you seek and to ensure that you meet the criteria specified in our advisor qualifications.

Once you're approved, you'll be able to specify hours of availability and we'll start to search
for opportunities to put your talent to use. If a guardian is interested in you, we'll arrange a way
for you and the guardian to connect so that you can begin helping a child in need.

I am capable of providing care to children. I have the following qualifications:

* [ ] first aid
* [ ] x
* [ ] y

## I need care

> I am looking to find someone to watch my child for a few hours.

> I am looking for someone to talk my child swimming.

If any of the statements above resonate with you then our technology could benefit you.

When you sign up, we'll ask you a series of questions about your child to help us
understand how we can best meet your needs. Our proprietary algorithm will start crunching
away to try to find the best possible care options for you. We'll provide you with personalized
profiles of the individuals who are qualified to meet your needs. If there is a match between
your child and the care giver, we will connect you and the care giver. We'll take care of
all the messy stuff, like scheduling, so that you can be the best guardian that you can be.

We care about your privacy, so we use military grade encryption to ensure that your data is
stored safely. We make it very easy for you to leave our system with all your data when you
no longer need our help.
